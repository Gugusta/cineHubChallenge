# Github Explorer

## Project Overview

**👨🏻‍💻 Hi everyone**
**The idea is to create a web application that allows the user to search for a user on Github and see the repositories of that user.**

### Main Technologies

- ReactJS
- Typescript
- React Testing
- React Router Dom
- Styled Components

To make this project more organized, I use ReactJS and Vite to create the project. I also use the Styled Components to create the styles of the project. To make the routes, I use the React Router Dom library.
